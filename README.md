A classic Tic-Tac-Toe game built as a web application using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. This project implements game logic to handle player turns, track the game state, and determine win or draw conditions.

This project was created as part of the web development tasks from **Prodigy InfoTech**.

## ‚ú® Features

- **Interactive Game Board**: A 3x3 grid that responds to user clicks.
- **Player Turns**: The game alternates between 'X' and 'O' players.
- **Win Detection**: The application automatically checks for winning conditions (three markers in a row, column, or diagonal).
- **Draw Detection**: If all cells are filled and no winner is found, the game declares a draw.
- **Game Status Display**: A message area indicates the current player's turn, the winner, or if the game is a draw.
- **Reset Functionality**: A "Restart Game" button allows players to clear the board and start a new game at any time.
- **Clean & Responsive UI**: The game is designed to be visually appealing and playable on various screen sizes.

*(Optional Feature as per task description: The current version supports Player vs. Player. An AI opponent could be added as a future enhancement.)*
